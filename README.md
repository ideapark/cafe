# Coffee

[‰∏≠Êñá](README.zh.md)

Remote network http(s) are relayed as local http over ssh tunnel.

## Use Case Scenario

`coffee` was born out to be used to make `remote network` http(s)
services available at local, so you're able to start your local coding
and debugging, without spinning up all the dependency services at
local, because these dependency http(s) services are hard or even
impossible to run at local:

1. they have their own dependency services or middlewares
2. too much resources (cpu, memory) are needed to run them all
3. too much effort to ensure them always work (e,g. new version came out)

In one word, you just want all the dependency http(s) services out
there and always ready to be comsumed. so you could focus on your own
business.

## How it looks like

- help

The default port `2046` will be used if `-port` not specified, and
every http roundtripping object will be logged out to stdout.

```bash
$ ./coffee --help
Usage of coffee:
  -port int
        use another serving port (default 2046)
  -trace
        trace every http roundtrip object (default true)
```

- run it & keep watching

Start `coffee`, it will start relaying the urls you have configured to
the remote network.

```bash
$ ./coffee
coffee üçµüçµüçµ

The following remote network http(s) are relayed as local http:

http://www.vulnweb.com.127.0.0.1.nip.io:2046
http://rest.vulnweb.com.127.0.0.1.nip.io:2046
http://www.gnu.org.127.0.0.1.nip.io:2046
http://kernel.org.127.0.0.1.nip.io:2046

- curl request will be relayed to the remote network

Have a try for one of the relayed urls.

```bash
# curl -I http://www.gnu.org.127.0.0.1.nip.io:2046

## Make it work for your environment

```json
{
  "wild": ".127.0.0.1.nip.io",
  "urls": [
    "http://www.vulnweb.com",
    "http://rest.vulnweb.com",
    "https://www.gnu.org",
    "https://kernel.org"
  ],
  "hops": [
    {
      "host": "127.0.0.1",
      "port": "22",
      "user": "ENV:USER",
      "pass": "ENV:PASS1",
      "key": "FILE:~/.ssh/id_rsa"
    },
    {
      "host": "localhost",
      "port": "22",
      "user": "ENV:USER",
      "pass": "ENV:PASS2",
      "key": "FILE:~/.ssh/id_rsa"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Update `coffee.json`

1. replace `urls` array with your service urls at the remote network 
2. instruct `coffee` how to reach your remote network hop by
   hop. (`user`, `pass`, `key` are kept secure by reading from env or
   file optionally)
3. `wild` suffix can be changed to any public wild dns that resovles to `127.0.0.1` (optional)

### Build

Compile the final single binary release. happy `coffee`

```bash
make
```
